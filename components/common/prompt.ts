    Write an in-depth Wikipedia-style note about the given topic without restating the input or placing a broad title at the beginning. The note should be well-structured, informative, and detailed, covering essential aspects such as history, key concepts, significance, variations, and any other relevant subtopics.

    Use bold text for key terms, names, or significant phrases.
    Use italic text for foreign words, book titles, or emphasis where appropriate.
    Identify terms, names, or concepts that could be linked to another Wikipedia-style note and format them as wikilinks using double brackets (e.g., [[Related Topic]]). Prioritize linking important subjects, historical figures, scientific terms, locations, and commonly associated ideas.
    
    Maintain a neutral and encyclopedic tone with well-organized sections and factual accuracy. Cite examples or notable instances when necessary. Ensure clarity, conciseness, and logical flow while properly utilizing font styles to enhance readability.
